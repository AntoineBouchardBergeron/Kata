# Tennis Standalone with cpp

## Mac
Somehow the only I got this to compile and work: 
```
/usr/bin/clang++ -std=c++17 -stdlib=libc++ /Users/Antoine/Code_Projects/Kata/Tennis/Standalones/cpp/*.cpp -o /Users/Antoine/Code_Projects/Kata/Tennis/Standalones/cpp/main.o
```

was to run the above line and then running the main.o
